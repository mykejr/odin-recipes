        <h5>
          How to, here goes
        </h5>
        <p> 
            Mix the dry ingredients all together in a bowl. Add the tomato pure and the 4 tablespoons of oil <br>
            and add the 4 tablespoons of water. Now mix these all together for a perfect mass mixture <br>
            Massage nicely in the meat <br>
        At this stage I'd recommend to start heating up the oven to 130 celsius <br>
        Heat up a big enough sauce pan (no plastic parts since it will go in the oven) with a lid. <br>
        Now add the oil and the meat and fry all sides <br>
        Chop up and add the onion and the rest of the mass, the ketchup, water, ACV and the worcestershire and soy sauce <br>
        Mix well and once it start to boil cover and put it in the preheated oven for 4 hours <br>
        <br>
        Once finished take it out of the oven <strong>BE EXTRA CAREFUL BECAUSE PAN IS HOT</strong> and take the meat out into a bowl <br>
        Use 2 forks or similar to pull the meat apart but don't make it into tiny bits but chunks. <br>
        If you like it more moist you can add the sauce from the pan. Now you can also boil the sauce a bit more and use it as a topping. <br>
